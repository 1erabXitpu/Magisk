Thanks, Leonie -- In my case, after exporting my slideshow from Photos (without a sound track) as a video, and importing it to a movie track in Garageband, I would want to use parts of commercial songs, probably from iTunes.

I saw, via your Garageband help link, that "You can import audio files of the following file types into a GarageBand project: AIFF, CAF, WAV, AAC (except protected AAC files), Apple Lossless, and MP3."
 
Thanks, Leonie - I think I understand, but I don't know how to get the info you show. I went to iTunes 12.7.3, clicked on a song (I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face, by Rex Harrison), and I could play 30 secs of it or say I wanted to purchase it, but nowhere did I see whether it was protected or purchased. Should I just assume it'll say purchased because it would be a "new iTunes purchase"?
 
I went thru Slideshow maker wizard & set the properties to do that & selected the audio file I want in place of the default background music but when the wizard completes the audio track isn't there. I have to manually import it then it doesn't sync up.
 
A fade-out would be an option but personally I always ensure the music ending coincides with the end of the slideshow. Which of course might include credits, fades, etc. The most obvious approach I take is to use music that is a bit longer than the slideshow and trim and fade in the start. If the music's start is essential then I cut it elsewhere, overlapping the sections at a point which coincides with relatively high volume in the other audio, either a video clip or my added microphone narrative.
 
My music library is kept on MediaMonkey and I typically sort my current 5,400 tracks by genre and then duration before browsing for a suitable choice. Sometimes, if the video is particularly long, I use several tracks, appropriately placed.
 
Thanks to both of you. I neglected to mention time is a huge factor in this case. I'm putting this together for the memorial service for my last brother who passed away Friday night after a 3 year battle with colon cancer. I didn't start it sooner because I've been staying here helping to take care of him. He had shown marked improvement after the first month I was here. I was cooking for him & he was eating & gaining weight. But I had to go back home 2000 miles away for my own doctor appointments. In the three weeks I was home his condition deteriorated rapidly. But I still thought I could help him recover again. I was wrong. He went from a weak lucidity to completely unresponsive in less than 72 hours.
 
All the while I wasn't thinking about a memorial service so I'm just getting this together. I'll work on editing the music selections down if there is no way to change a setting similar to the ones in the wizard to match the two up.
 
I've tried going to the "Title" tab, selecting "Standard" then dragging the "Default" title to the end of the last photo. That winds up with the title on top of every frame in the slideshow. I tried putting it on a separate track and it winds up with the title on top of every photo frame in the slideshow. The manual, in true Xara/Magix fashion is blissfully vague, contributing not even one useful tidbit of information to help me figure it out. As usual, for some reason, the way I think of finding a topic in the index is nothing even close to the way the writers of the manual choose to create said index.
 
Just to prove to myself that MEP MX is easier than PowerPoint, I tried creating this in that app & while the overall creation in that app is less irritating, attempting achieve effects like Pan or Zoom in PP make me want to remove the two appendages that are unique to the male of most species using, say, an ice cream scoop.
 
So I am stuck in between two apps. Each does certain things much more easily than the other, yet both deny me the small satisfaction of generating a finished product that is anything more than a dull, amateurish pictorial review of the 58 years of my brother's too short life that any first grader could produce in their sleep.
 
Can you please tell me how to accomplish what, by all accounts, should be such a simple, brainless task: Insert one blank frame at the end of 120 frames, on which to place a few words, then display that frame after all the other frames for about 22:03 seconds.
 
PS. Yes, I am very frustrated. I've just lost my last sibling and my best friend & I just want to do this small & insignificant tribute. I never in a million years thought anything could be such an insurmountable, hateful undertaking.

 
Assuming that you have previously downloaded and installed all of the Free Addons (see under the Help tab), then go to Effects, Design elements, and look in Test images or Backgrounds for a suitable image to put behind your text. A text object has to be on another object, either an image or a video. Drag the image to the end of track 1 and extend it to match the end of the music. Select this object and create your text. Drag to text to match close to the length. I use scrolling text in cases like this. You can also overlay an image (PIP) or two at one side and move the text to scroll at the other side. In that case, you wouldn't need the background image.
 
Thanks so much!! OK, one final (I hope) question. I settled on a background object, a ,mxv object, to be specific. Everything's great except one thing. Try though I might, I cannot adjust the time on it to anything other than its default 15 seconds. Can those backgrounds not be adjusted?
 
Just to make sure I'm not completely losing my mind, playing the slideshow within the program is simply a preview, right? I'm getting a lot of hiccups and stutters that should go away when I export the file?
 
Since I can't see your screen, and I don't have the same version on my computer anymore, I can only guess. Make sure that you are in Timeline mode and not Storyboard. Press on the End key. Then scroll down to make sure that you have nothing that shouldn't be there. You should have access to everything in timeline mode.
 
If you want to burn to DVD, then you have a new problem, deciding on a template. Alternatively, you can turn this off. Normally, a DVD starts with a startup screen, and then you press play or select a movie or a chapter. I suggest a couple of tests to make sure that it works.
 
Thankfully, once I was able to get over the hump of inserting a title/panel/whatever you want to call it, the rest was fairly intuitive. Again, I'm so grateful for all your help. The end result came out pretty good despite some fixable glitches & one that, again, has me cowed.
 
Don't worry about the split audio file unless you trimmed something. You can split any object multiple times and there is no impact so long as nothing moves. If you really want to do this, delete the right object and drag the right end of the remaining part to the right, up to the end when there it won't go anymore. The entire object or file is always there, it's just that you are only asking the program to play the part that you have on the arranger. Even the right object that you erase is the entire file/object. Move it to a blank track and drag the left end towards the right to see.
 
Remember that MEP is a non-destructive editor. Your original files are never touched. The project is just a set of instructions telling how to use the files. That means that the files are not actually in the program or project, they are just used by it and have to remain available in the same location as where you fetched them. So do not delete the audio, video or image files from your computer. You can read up on this when you have more time.
 
I'll get this done, exported & burned first thing tomorrow. It'ssuch a load off my mind now that the worst part is over. Hmmm, that sentiment is pretty universal, at least given the current situation.
 
Slideshows are most frequently used to create professional presentations for business meetings, conferences, and educational purposes. A slideshow program allows people to organize content, include visuals, and enhance the overall impact of their message.
 
Slideshow makers are popular for creating photo and video presentations, especially for events like weddings, birthdays, and vacations. People can add transitions, music, and captions to fully bring the photo-sharing experience to life.
 
In collaborative settings, teams use slideshow makers to create joint presentations or reports. The best slideshow makers enable multiple contributors to add their content simultaneously, which helps ensure a cohesive and unified presentation.
 
Handy presenter tools go a long way toward making your slideshow experience seamless. For example, straightforward slide navigation, slideshow keyboard shortcuts, pen and highlighter markup, and adjustable resolution settings.
