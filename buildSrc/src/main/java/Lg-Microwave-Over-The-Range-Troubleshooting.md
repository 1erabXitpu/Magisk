kimnrhoades, in order to help you solve the problem it would be best to give more information. Is it new? Is it second hand? Have you checked to see if there is power to the sock that you have the microwave plugged into?

I have a kitchen aid under Cabinet microwave and replaced all 3 bulbs it was working before I did so but as soon as I placed the one inside and plugged it back in and as soon as I opened it there's nothing it's like a fuse blew,is that possible
 
These things will kill you. I don't recommend trying to fix it. I wouldn't even try to fix my own. Either get a new one (they're relatively cheap now) or call a serviceman. Your fuse has probably blown out but there's a reason it did so please don't mess with it.
 
Thank you. I think you offered the best advice of all. I do know enough about electricity not to touch anything I don't understand. I'll simply heat foods and coffee the old fashioned way - on the stove or in the oven - until I save up for a new microwave.
 
Likely the fuse blew. Unplugged oven, GFI socket works fine (test with fan). Let it sit, plugged it back in. Nothing. Display doesn't light, no interior lamp when door opens. No externally visible fuse.

Bummed I can't fix it, can't see buying a $$ fuse to see if it blows too. What resistance should I read on the load side of the open fuse? Dunno. I remember when TVs melted the wax from flyback transformers. A hard fail somewhere else.
 
I've fixed all kinds of problems, professionally. For $154 plus tax I don't have a service or repair cost, and don't have to wonder. Send 1 paper grocery bag to land fill, a week. Litter box contents. Used Kleenex(tm). Broken glass or ceramic. Paper-plastic blends. Everything else composted or recycled. Ok w/ a microwave every 8 years.
 
2. Mis-operation of the oven by the user. The door interlock switches arer a safety feature designed to stop the oven from operating when the door is opened thereby preventing harmful microwave radiation from escaping the oven cavity. When the door is closed the oven cavity acts like a Faraday cage and contains the microwaves. The problem is that people just open the door to stop the oven when they think it has cooked far enough or they want to add things etc rather than using the oven controls i.e. pause button or start/stop button.
 
Although I agree with not touching anything inside the unit a fuse replacement is an easy fix. on most microwaves all you do is remove the cabinet and you should see the fuse in the open. use a fuse removal tool and replace it with the same voltage and amp fuse. DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING ELSE!!!! The capacitor inside the has enough voltage up to 300 volts to deliver a good zap. The magnatron from what I understand will kill you.
 
Without even touching the wires, try discharging the capacitor using an inappropriate tool e.g. a small screwdriver and check what it can do to it. Be careful as the resultant flash can be blinding and the tip of the screwdriver has either melted or been welded to the capacitor.
 
I realize that a screwdriver is more conductive than the human body but using Ohm's law with a screwdriver having a resistance value of even 10 Ohms will give a current flow of 400A-600A if only for a second or two depending on the discharge TC (time constant) value of the capacitor (TC in seconds = C F x R Ohms) and that is long enough
 
It is difficult to give an exact answer from your question since more information is needed. To narrow the fault down a technician will make a number of observations and tests. You have made a start but here are a few more:
 
No power at all: Most likely the internal fuse. As previously mentioned above, follow the power cord into circuit board. Check ceramic fuse with an ohm meter if possible or just replace it. Replace it with the EXACT SAME fuse that you took out. It is possible that it took a surge and blew. It is perfectly safe to replace.
 
So honestly, if my microwave had a blown fuse and I trashed it for a new one I would feel like I traded in my car because the battery was dead. We all need to minimize our disposable habits. Stay safe and use common sense.
 
Have this unit and has been a good unit till last night. I can turn the unit on, all lights work, fan seems to be working, but it is sounding very strange. Last night sparks started flying out of the side vents. Upon opening the unit, you could smell something was burning. Obvously it is not working. I assume it is either the magnitron or the transformer. Is there any way to tell? It looks like I can replace both parts for about $120 or I can purchase a similar unit for $350. The problem is the new units are larger and will require some modification of the space in the kitchen. Should I:
 
wotrubadick, if you are a technician check the HV fuse, HV cap, and check for shorts from magnetron filament to ground. If you are not a technician take it to to a business or a technician for repair.
 
We have brand new Kenmore microwave. It works fine for almost 1.5 years and now we cant use it. The light and vent are working but we hit start button to heat food, power goes off. Tried it several times, and our panel break goes off. What should we do?
 
If you have familiarity with repairing electrical products you could attempt a repair. If you don't then take it in for repair. The fault could be caused by a number of components namely a door switch, HV capacitor, or transformer/inverter.
 
unit goes on...all functions work but after about 4 seconds downshifts to slow as its barely running for several seconds then cuts out...just like a car down shifting from high gear to low gear reducing speed
 
I have the same problem, no power for my microwave. I checked fuses but they are good including thermal fuse and the thermostat. They all provide continuity. What else will cause complete no power for my microwave??
 
A standard microwave oven is actually a simple device comprising of a transformer, diode, capacitor, a fuse and the magnetron valve. All can be tested and replaced to fix a non heating oven. Watch the video.
 
My Whirlpool over the counter microwave which is giving me no problems at all it is only 2 years old. As I was heating up my dinner it worked fine I heated Something else up then all of a sudden it tells me to close the door and push start and when I push start it just clicks and does nothing else everything else on the microwave seems to be working
 
That star screw head is actually called a Torx security screw, the pin in the middle is what makes it a security screw. A mating Torx bit or driver of the appropriate size. You can buy a set of them or a combination set with standard from GearBest from the UK. They are fairly common in the U.S. In Dollars, they cost around 8.00-20.00. eBay is a good source, also. Thank you for enlightening me on what to look for and expect. My 15-year-old Panasonic has been flawless, until tonight.
 
We moved into our house in 2012 and had an over the range microwave installed. We purchased it new prior to moving in. There was already a spot for it but the people who sold us the house took theirs with them. This microwave was an LG and it worked until 2014 where one day it just started popping and sparking from behind the control panel when I turned it on to cook something. We replaced the microwave with a Magic Chef one. This one lasted just over a year. Just in time for the warranty to run out and it too began popping and sparking behind the control panel when you turn it on. We replaced it with another Magic chef microwave but a different model on 12/12/16. Yesterday it, too started popping and sparking when I turned it on. Is there something I'm doing wrong? The microwave was properly installed. We even had the electricity checked. It read 120 volts on the meter the electrician used. My house amps is 200. My husband thinks that the popping and sparking is the magnetron of the microwave. But why do they keep breaking? Anyone have any suggestions?
 
I'm wondering if I'm the cause. I do run a daycare so the microwave does get a lot of use. Warming up bottles and cooking lunch every day. Do microwaves have a life expectancy before they go kaput? Could moisture be getting into the magnetron causing it to short out? Is it a requirement to run the exhaust fan on the microwave when cooking on my stove? I have to admit I'm not a fan of the sound of the fan so I don't use it as often as I should.
 
shadowcat\_378 popping and sparking could most certainly be a sign of a cracked magnet and the only viable repair would be to replace the magnetron. Here is the thing so, there are some pretty powerful capacitors on the inside of your microwave. If those do not get properly discharged they will pack a punch. We are talking lights-out punch here! So if you are not quite sure you want to fix your microwave by yourself, **don't!**
 
I also have this problem -my LG over range microwave stopped working after 18 months and same with my GE over range microwave.... thinking it might have something to do with moisture from the steam by product of cooking on the stove top
 
When it comes to outfitting a kitchen, most folks choose a beefy range or snazzy refrigerator as the focal point. A microwave is likely an afterthought. But choosing an over-the-range microwave that will give you years of solid service is definitely worth the attention.
 
In our member survey, we found that owners of OTR microwaves were roughly divided between having the repairs done by manufacturers, independent repair shops, and DIYers, with a smaller number reaching out to retailers for help. Our 2021 survey shows that when a repair was attempted, 86 percent were successful.
 
According to NYC Zero Waste, microwaves are considered appliances and not electronic waste. The agenc
