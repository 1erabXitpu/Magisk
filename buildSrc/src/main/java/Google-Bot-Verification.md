You can add multiple verification methods in your property's verification settings page. You might want to add more than one verification method in case one of your existing verification methods fails (for example, if you verified using a Google Analytics tracking code, and someone changes a template on your website that omits the tag).

Multiple people can verify ownership of the same website property, using the same or different verification methods. If you use the same verification method, just be sure that you don't overwrite the verification tokens of any other owners.
 
Once you have verified a property, any child properties that you add will be auto-verified using the same verification method as the parent. That is, if you verified ownership of example.com using the HTML file upload method, any child properties that you create (m.example.com or ) will be auto-verified using the same HTML file upload.
 
Verification lasts as long as Search Console can confirm the presence and validity of your verification token. Search Console periodically checks if your verification token is still present and valid. If verification can no longer be confirmed, you will be notified. If the issue is not fixed, your permissions on that property will expire after a certain grace period.

If you are taking over a site from another owner, after you verify ownership you can unverify previous owners by removing their verification token (for example, removing the HTML tag from the site, for HTML-tag-verified owners). See Add or remove owners for more information.
 
Verify ownership of a site by uploading a special HTML file to a specific location on your site. This file is tied to a specific user. Follow the instructions on the verification details page. Removing this verification file from your site will cause you to lose verification for the site.
 
Verify your ownership of a site by adding a tag to the HTML of a specified page. We'll verify that the meta tag exists on that page. If we can't find the tag, we'll give you information about the error we encountered. This tag is tied to a specific user. Search Console will periodically check for the presence of this tag.
 
**Is the meta tag on the correct page?** We look for it in the rendered source of your site's home page. This is the page where your browser goes when you visit the URL that defines your Search Console property.
 
Add a DNS record to your domain provider's record list to prove ownership. This is required only for Domain property, (example.com) not URL-prefix properties ( ). If you use this method on a URL-prefix property, you will also be auto-verified for the Domain property.
 
You can verify ownership of root domains (example.com) or subdomains (m.example.com). Verifying ownership of a root domain automatically verifies ownership of all subdomains, but verifying ownership of a subdomain does not verify ownership of a parent domain. For example: verifying ownership of m.example.com also verifies ownership of pets.m.example.com, but does not verify ownership of example.com.
 
If you use Google Analytics to track your site's traffic and you have edit permission in the account, you can verify your site using the Google Analytics tracking code used on your site. You must be logged into Search Console with the same Google Account used to manage Google Analytics.
 
If you have a Google Tag Manager account active on your site and you have Publish or Admin permission, you can verify ownership of your site using your Google Tag Manager container snippet code. You must be logged into Search Console with the same Google Account used to manage Tag Manager.
 
New blogs that you create in Blogger should be added and verified automatically in your Search Console account. If your blog doesn't appear automatically on the Search Console home page, add the property and it should be verified automatically.
 
If you are using a tag-based verification method (Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, or the HTML tag methods), Search Console will look for your verification tag in the page to which a non-logged-in user is redirected when visiting the URL that defines your property.
 
An Offset Project Operator or Authorized Project Designee must obtain the services of an ARB-accredited verification body to perform offset verification services. A list of accredited offset verification bodies and offset verifiers can be found at the links below.
 
The verification body must also submit information for a Conflict of Interest Self-evaluation to ARB and the applicable Offset Project Registry with which the project is listed. The Offset Project Registry must approve the conflict of interest.
 
ARB has developed general guidance on the offset verification program. In addition, ARB will develop Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) that will be continuously updated as answers to specific questions are established. FAQs will be developed for offset verification related issues in general, as well as specifically for each Compliance Offset Protocol**.**
 
To conduct offset verification services, offset verification bodies and offset verifiers will need to submit information during verification activities, including NOVS, COI, and Offset Verification Statements. ARB will make forms related to the offset program, including verification related forms, available on the Compliance Offset Program Forms webpage. They can also be accessed on the web page of each Offset Project Registry.
 
Offset verification bodies and offset verifiers must be accredited by ARB to perform verification for compliance offset projects. To become accredited, potential verification bodies and offset verifiers must submit an application and meet the requirements for education and experience as defined in section 95132 of the Mandatory Reporting Regulation.
 
The applications below must be completed and submitted to ARB to begin the Verifier and/or Verification Body accreditation process. If the Verifier applicant satisfies all the requirements of the regulation, they will be notified of the dates and times of approved ARB Compliance Offset Program and Compliance Offset Protocol training classes. Upon successful completion of training, the Verifier may be accredited by the Executive Officer. Once Verifiers are accredited and the Verification Body meets the minimum staffing requirements of the regulation, the Verification Body may be accredited by the Executive Officer.
 
CARB and its contracted trainer Greenhouse Gas Management Institute (GMGMI) are offering online offset verifier training (since mid-2023).

For more information about CARB's offset verifier training, please contact Stephen Shelby (916-570-7953).

The U.S. Department of Education requires selected students and parents to verify the data reported on the FAFSA. This is not an indication that you have completed the FAFSA incorrectly. Most students are selected for **verification** randomly and each year, approximately 30% of FAFSA filers are required to complete verification. Financial aid will not be disbursed until all requested documents have been submitted and reviewed. If the documents submitted require FSU to make corrections to your FAFSA, then your financial aid awards may be adjusted in accordance with your eligibility.
