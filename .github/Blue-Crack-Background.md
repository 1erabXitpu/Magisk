1.You CAN print with no background, I did it before with my previous Epson Photo Stylus R800 pinter. When you look at the print you can clearly see that no ink is used on the transparent parts. I'll try to describe what I mean with transparent; creating a blank psd document with no background then including a layer that is smaller than the psd first created. This gives light blue where it should be white.

What did you do to get rid of the light blue blackground. I am having the same issue, and it is super-important, for a project. It prints with light blue background. Where did you change the mode? Help please
 
If you change the mode in photoshop from RGB to LAB colour, then the blue background when printing to PDF Should disapear. Be careful and make sure you save your file before as this requires you to flatten the documennt so it then has no layers.
 
i've NO idea how this happened but whilst editing all of a sudden (I must have done something right? ... RIGHT???) i cannot seem to undo the appearance of a blue background photoshop screen behind my photos. I hate it. And I somehow did it.
 
Did it happen in this session? Your History panel says all you did was open the file and assign a profile. Since you saved and closed, it's too late for Undo. You can only undo during the current session.
 
I have scanned a document, and now I need to print it. The document has both black and blue on it. However, it has a white background. When I print it from Photoshop it prints with a light blue background, instead of white. Anybody knows what to do in order to remove that? So again, it's a white background on the original paper and in Photoshop, but when print it comes out with a light blue background.
 
The issue was sorted out as it follows: indeed, because it was scanned as a photo, the document inherited a light blue background. I edited that in Photoshop by adjusting Image->Adjustments->Levels, I picked the color from the background and it turned it into white automatically
 
White clothes are a great go-to color for a bright colored background. This will put skintones into a color saturation middle-ground. With dark/black clothes our brains sort-of disqualify it from our impression of saturation. So that would leave the person's face and hair looking dull and neutral in contrast, which in turn puts too much emphasis on the background, making it distracting.

It looks like you have a very light blue background. Keep in mind that lighting from behind (such as a hairlight or rimming) may blend edges into the background, losing definition. Unless you can keep enough light off the background to get it around mid-toned, then adding a bright rim would be a positive thing.
 
For a graduation portrait, you want something that will provide good contrast but not clash too aggressively with the background. To maintain contrast, avoid blues that are close to the backdrop (if not altogether). For a medium blue, probably avoid medium greys as well since they have similar luminosity to the background.
 
As this is a graduation photo, assuming that the school colors are not blue or orange, it might be worth suggesting that color. Often graduation photos are taken wearing a cap and gown as well (either black or whatever color the school uses).
 
If they used black (minimum intensity for all three color channels) or white (maximum intensity for all color channels) you might think they are off, so instead they use only one of their base color channels (out of Red Green Blue).
 
Regarding the BSoD, if it where white, some users may not understand why their open document has strange text in it. If it where black, some may not understand why DOS is open instead of Windows and the same reasoning behind red and green from the projectors still applies.
 
I think the blue goes back to the days of consumer-grade video cassette recorders with on-screen message displays. Superimposing an image on a video signal requires that one know which parts of the signal will be displayed where on the screen. If the video signal includes valid horizontal and vertical sync pulses, one can measure the time since the last horizontal sync pulse, and count the number of horizontal pulses since the last vertical sync pulse, and know where that part of the signal will be displayed.
 
If, however, a video signal has no horizontal or vertical sync pulse, a television set's horizontal and vertical scanning circuitry will start "free-running", and there will be no predictable relationship between signal timing and screen location. On-screen message electronics that are built into a television set can be triggered by free-running vertical and horizontal sweep generators well enough to produce a legible (though often slightly garbled) overlay, but electronics built into a VCR have no way of knowing the timing of a television set's horizontal and vertical sweep in the absence of sync pulses. The only way for a VCR to produce readable on-screen messages in the absence of a valid input video signal is to generate a video signal itself.
 
Generating a black and white video signal is slightly easier than generating a color signal, but not hugely so. With NTSC (North American) video, one can get color by adding a pulse of a 3.579545MHz reference signal at the start of each line, and adding a 3.579545Mhz signal to anything that should appear in color. The hue of a colored object will depend upon the phase relationship with the reference signal, but lightness and saturation are a little less predictable. Yellow is the easiest hue to generate (same phase as reference), but blue is the second-easiest (exactly-opposite phase), and variations in lightness and saturation are less noticeable with blue. Thus, generation of a blue screen has technical advantages versus any other color.
 
Once video cassette recorders started including the blue screen as a standard no-signal indication, many television sets started following suit. From a technical standpoint, a television doesn't need to generate an "idle" signal in the same way that a VCR does, but consumers wondered why the feature should be unique to their VCR, and television sets had no particular reason not to include it, so the behavior is included in many sets.
 
The term "Blue Screen of Death" originated during OS/2 pre-release development activities at Lattice Inc, the makers of an early Windows and OS/2 C compiler. During porting of Lattice's other tools, developers encountered the stop screen when null pointers were dereferenced either in application code or when unexpectedly passed into system API calls. During reviews of progress and feedback to IBM Austin, the developers described the stop screen as the Blue Screen of Death to denote the screen and the finality of the experience.
 
And a "fatal system error" is no kidding. "This is serious stuff your dealing with, so pay attention"-color which would be **blue**. This is not the color of error (which would be red) but the color representing the whole thing as the sky and the sea and everything. Serious!
 
The red pill and its opposite, the blue pill, are pop culture symbols representing the choice between embracing the sometimes painful truth of reality (red pill) and the blissful ignorance of illusion (blue pill).
 
As one of the respondents already mentioned, blue is the color of the sky and the sea, and in general represents tranquillity. So, psychologically, so that the user does get upset, seems ergonomic designers picked a blue blank screen for when things go wrong.
 
You can also use variant modifiers to target media queries like responsive breakpoints, dark mode, prefers-reduced-motion, and more. For example, use md:bg-green-500 to apply the bg-green-500 utility at only medium screen sizes and above.
 
By default, Tailwind makes the entire default color palette available as background colors. You can customize your color palette by editing theme.colors or theme.extend.colors in your tailwind.config.js file.
 
Okay, I don't know why I'm having such difficulty finding an answer online. I found an example of the sign on Google Images but the hosting site is down and there is no cache, and searches using "blue background red cross white arrow" aren't turning up relevant results. [Update, 2019: Now they do! This page being the top result.]
 
It was affixed to a side signal, so I thought it might mean to indicate that this side signal is a separate turn signal one should adhere to in order to make right turns (presumably to protect bicyclists and pedestrians).
 
Arrows inside the circle are unrelated to any turn but specify the area of validity of the sign (it starts where there is a road-pointing arrow and ends where there is a an arrow pointing away from the road). In your case, and assuming the sign was placed on the right of the road, it would mean it's forbidden to stop before the sign (and the intersection).
 
Red circle means Prohibition, round signal means law-enforced (as per driving code and rules), upper left to lower right red bar means prohibition to park your vehicle (2 or more minutes and stopped engine supposes your car is parked) and upper left to lower right with a 'mirrored' lower left to upper right red bar means prohibition to park or pulling over your car(be it to get up or down your car people or things) and the white arrows indicate "from this sign up the direction the arrow is pointing".
