After missing one appointment, you will receive a call and a warning, but after the second missed appointment, you will not be allowed to sign up during the remainder of the semester. You may, however, use The Write Place on a drop-in basis.

**What can I expect during an appointment?**
Tutors will assist you in a variety of ways. They will help you with the steps in the writing process: brainstorming, outlining, and thesis construction, to name a few. They will also suggest ways to improve both the content and the structure of your paper. Although The Write Place is not an editing service, we do attempt to help you improve your grammar and punctuation skills.
 
**What do I need to bring to an appointment?**
Print your paper ahead of time and bring it with you. Also, bring any instructions from your professor that may help us evaluate the content and format.

**What can I do if all the time slots are full?**
Unfortunately, our schedule is limited; therefore, if the time slots are full, write your name and extension at the bottom of the page so we can call you if we have a cancellation. Otherwise, sign up for the next appointment time that works with your schedule.
 
**Will The Write Place help me prepare for the proficiency exam?**
Yes, we are always available to help students review for the proficiency exam. At particularly busy times, The Write Place offers 30-minute sessions for small groups of students. During these review sessions, we discuss expectations regarding structure, content, and language; grading policies; and common errors to avoid. We also answer other questions students may have concerning the test. (When group sessions are available, you will find the sign-up sheets posted on the wall next to the appointment book.)
 
I have been a book author and artist for close to twenty years. I have paid for my mortgage, groceries, vacations and braces with my self-generated income. I have sold a blessed two million copies of my words and pictures.
 
Today I want us to practice owning our GIFT and TALENT as writers. Wholeheartedly. Even if we're not generating ANY income from it. Talent and ability are not always cash-making but are still real and worth our belief.
 
Do you ever downplay your talent as a writer? Self-critique to save someone else the trouble? For today's practice, introduce yourself and your work in the comments section in the most confident, self-assured way possible! In addition to practicing this important skill, we will all get to learn a little more about one another! Who knows? Maybe you'll find a kindred spirit in the crowd.
 
Needless to say, my mom took me to see a professional. She took me to a hospital, actually (yeah, it was that bad). I remember I had to stay sitting in one of those beds with a puke tray near me at all times. A male nurse, nicest guy ever, held the tray as my hands trembled. A string of something came out of my mouth as I vomited again. I could have sworn it was my small intestine, but I guess it was just mucus. He patted my back when I would choke and gave me comforting words when I finished each of my episodes.
 
Did you have fun writing that paper? Maybe you could do something similar (perhaps on a smaller scale, or whatever size suits you) with your action sentences, dialogue, exposition. Try writing a page or so using only dialogue. Or action. You get it. Actually, I think I might do that. Thanks for the idea!
 
Hi Alicia! When I read your self-assured description, I see a woman with a LOT of writing experience! And who has much to offer! I would love to read your writings on the afterlife. Losing both my parents in one year has caused me to ponder this very topic!!
 
James, I feel like I know you from all your insights, comments and caring on this forum. I admire your fire for writing and your desire to be read all over the world and I am going to believe that with you. Since I live in Canada, you have a start with this fan outside of the US.
 
Well hello there! My name is Jevonnah Ellison and I am a Leadership Coach and Writer. My first book, The Journey to Excellence, will launch early next year. Stay posted for details and sign up for a free gift at
 
Publishing is filled with more questions than answers it seems. It all too often depends on the book, genre, and specifics. I wish you luck on your journey. What would you be most proud of your blog? Share a link to a favorite work of yours.
 
There are links to my published work at my blog: justinemanzano.wordpress.com. Unfortunately, I am not an extremely prolific short story writer, so there is only one published piece available for reading, aside from my semi-monthly blog posts. ?
 
I am still very shy about sharing my writing. My husband is the only person who has read what I am currently working on. I like to write about real-life situations and I am a sucker for a great romance story ?
 
I am writing and illustrating picture books and what a learning curve that is turning out to be. I also write young adult fiction and am about to attempt Nanowrimo challenge. When I started my blog a year ago I called myself an aspiring writer. After many posts, guest post, almost finished first picture book and linking up with many other passionate writers I now tell people that is what I am doing. This is a huge thing for me and I smile every time I hear my daughter say my mum is writing a book. It is not a question of if I will get published now, just a question of when my time is right.
 
Based on that you said you like to write about self-love and self-worth, which are excellent topics, I felt you might enjoy two short stories (< 1000 words each) that I wrote:
To Autumn
Reflections of a Mirror
 
To me, you are one of the most important people in this community. All these things you have written and accomplished are right there under your belt, and you continue to give and give and give helpful advice and the whole time I had *no idea* that I was hearing from a published author, a veteran in the field, an expert, more or less. Your humbleness is heartwarming and enviable!
I love that Dear Deb will be in Russia. In a way, she will travel there. Thanks for being a part of this community. I hope you continue being a wonderful person and lend your helping hands to those of us who are trying to get where you are. ?
 
You write about such moving and important topics. I can only hope that my fantasy novels say half the things your amazing stories tell. I would love to read your works. Is there anywhere I can find them?
 
Hello my name is Ava Mauriello and I have just started down this career path. I do not have a blog, but I have a vlog on YouTube with a web series called Thorns and I have an independent film critique segment. Please check out my YouTube channel. I would love to hear your feedback! My goals would be to have my channel become more successful (and higher budget haha!). Also I would love to write/direct short films and eventually independent features! I would love to be like Shane Carruth. I would like to make films independently without going the Hollywood route, so I can have more creative control.
 
Thank you, James. I am glad you enjoyed it and got something out of it. I had a lot more I could have said but wanted it to be an easy quick read. I am planning to write a bigger book on the same subject but a little more in depth. Thanks for checking it out! ?
 
I have been writing for a few years now, but only over the last two years did I embrace the title-writer. It took a while, but once I did I started enjoying writing everyday and introducing myself(when asked) as a writer.
Very nice meeting you all. Its great to find other writers out there who may be going through the same things I went and go through as an indie.
 
Among the great variety of the assessment professor and instructors of both traditional and online education can come with, there few most common types of the exams. First, your exam can be either oral or written, seen or unseen (depending on whether you had a chance to get acquainted with the list of the questions) and open vs close book tests (some professors will let you take notes and//or books into the exam).
 
According to the Stanford University research on timed vs untimed assessment formats, the difference of results is insufficient, though, the stress levels difference is significant. If you are lucky enough to get away with the untimed exam or the test you can take at home and then submit in the class, you are more luckily to succeed with the lower rate of the failure probability. If you have to pass on online test assessment or an in-class test, there are few things you need to do before you begin to answer the very first question of the test:
 
Generally, a timed version of the exam will consist of 35-50 questions of different types, whereas an untimed exam by the end of the course could mean up to 250 questions of all types. So, let us focus on different types of exam question answer, along with some useful tips on how to choose the best answer for each type.
 
One of the most commonly used questions in languages and humanities tests. You will either have to choose the word from the options in the box or come up with your own answer, depending on the context and topic. This type requires basic knowledge of the information and or/language patterns. The typical example of fill in the gaps questions would be English test on verbs and required prepositions.
 
One of the most hated types of questions, when you have to change the structure of the first sentence so it would have the meaning of the seeding one. Most often can be found in English tests or any language studies. If you are allowed, try to use Thesaurus to help you f
